Experiments in LiveCode and python inter-communications


The python language is one of the most popular in use today. It has many, many libraries, covering a wide range of subjects which can be easily included. You can find a library for basically anything you could imagine: from web development, through game development, to machine learning.
python is a textual environment, inbuilt guis are missing and have to be added, normally after the bulk of coding has been completed.
There is no official gui maker, third party systems need to be employed.

LiveCode is an easy, English-like, object-oriented, event-driven programming language. It is a powerful, full featured language. It is used by many corporations, government agencies, academic institutions and school systems.
In LiveCode, you start by dropping GUI elements into place, then add the code that makes them function.... it's very visual!

So wouldn't it be great if we could employ the easy gui creation afforded by LiveCode with the python text eco system.
That's what this repository is about, my experiments with bi comunication between the two languages.
